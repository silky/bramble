Bramble is a project designed to act as a RAML parser, set of data-types, and client-generator.

It provides two interfaces:

* A Library
* An Executable

# Structure

[![Data Dependencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sordina/bramble/master/doc/data.png)](https://github.com/sordina/bramble/blob/master/doc/data.png)

# TODO

* Use a real schema such as https://github.com/timjb/aeson-schema/blob/master/aeson-schema.cabal
  or https://github.com/seagreen/hjsonschema/blob/master/hjsonschema.cabal
* Show the failure path in parsing errors
* Curretly depends on [my fork of wreq - PR pending](https://github.com/bos/wreq/pull/66)
